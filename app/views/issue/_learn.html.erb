These issue areas were created and assigned by the Congressional Research Service, a government agency created by Congress to provide non-partisan research. With over 4,000 issue areas to browse here on OpenCongress, there are lots of ways to connect a general issue you care about to a specific bill in Congress.

While you're browsing, keep in mind that these issue areas are often narrowed down into specific sub-categories. For example, the issue of "the environment" is narrowed down as follows: "environmental assessment," "environmental degredation," "environmental economics," and thirteen more sub-categories. On the <%= link_to 'Issues', :controller => 'issue' %> page, you can sort issues in one of three ways: by Name Alphabetically, by Most Viewed, or by Most Associated, which means that the issue is affected by the largest number of bills in Congress. If you're interested in a particular issue, you can use the corresponding issue page on OpenCongress to keep track of the latest bills and actions in that issue area.
