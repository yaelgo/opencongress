  <p class="behave">No bills at this time. The Congressional Research Service -- the official
  non-partisan think tank for Congress -- has not tagged any bills in the
  current 111th session of Congress with this issue area.</p>

  <p class="behave">The CRS tags bills in Congress with varying numbers of issue areas --
  sometimes just a couple, sometimes dozens. There are over 4,000 individual
  issue areas maintained by CRS, some of which are closely related -- for
  example, "environmental health", "environmental justice", "environmental
  law enforcement", etc.</p>

  <p class="behave">The CRS might yet tag bills with this issue area in the current session of
  Congress, but the likelihood of this for any given issue cannot be
  reliably predicted from the available data. In the future, we seek to work
  with Congress and other invested parties in order to open up the CRS
  process and help make their work more accessible in accordance with the <a
  href="http://www.opengovdata.org/">8 Principles of Open Government
  Data</a>.</p>

		 OpenCongress syndication panels allow you to display information about <a href="/resources/bill_status/">bills</a> and <a href="/resources/issue_bills/">issue areas</a> on your own website or blog. First, select which bill or issue you want to track, then customize the appearance of the panel, and finally paste a simple chunk of HTML into your site. Now your community will have an easy, up-to-date way to track the status of important bills and issues in Congress.
