Bills are the most common form of proposals for laws. In order to become a law, a bill must be approved by a majority vote in both the House and the Senate, and then must be approved by the President.

If the President vetoes a bill, the House and Senate can over-ride his veto with a two-thirds vote in favor, and then the bill becomes a law. Another form of proposal for a law is a joint resolution, which is often used for appropriations and to amend the Constitution. Other proposals are called resolutions and concurrent resolutions, which aren't designed to become laws, but rather to make decisions about how Congress manages its work process. After a bill is first introduced to Congress, it is considered in committees, where it may be changed, held indefinitely, or scrapped altogether. About 96% of bills never make it to becoming laws.
