When a bill is first introduced to Congress, it is referred to its appropriate committee. A committee is composed of a small group of members of Congress that first consider bills in a specific issue area.

Committees have the power to edit bills, add to bills, and hold hearings on bills. After this working process, a committee votes whether or not to send the bill to the House or the Senate for a full vote. Many times, a committee will vote not to pass along a bill -- in such cases, the bill is often called "stuck in committee," and is unlikely to become law in its current form. The House of Representatives, because of its larger size, makes more use of its committees. Each committee is usually made up of about the same proportion of Democrats and Republicans as is the full chamber. Each committee is led by a Chairperson from the current majority party. The Chair frequently exerts a great deal of power in controlling the flow of bills through committees and determining which bills will be approved.
