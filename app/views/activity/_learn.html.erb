Congress schedules action on bills by putting them on a calendar.
While the Senate has a single calendar for all of its business,
the House of Representatives has five.

The House calendars schedule
different kinds of business at different times. Most public bills and
resolutions appear on the Union Calendar. Those bills which do not have a
cost to the Government and some resolutions appear on the House Calendar.
Action on private bills is scheduled in the Private Calendar. Some measures
pending on the House or Union Calendars - which is of a non-contraversial
nature - may be placed on the Corrections Calendar. These tend to be of a
focused nature and have widespread support. Finally there is a Calendar of
Motions to Discharge Committees. A majority of members of the House may sign
a motion to remove a bill from committee consideration, or the Rules
Committee from further consideration of a particular rule, in particular
circumstances.
