  tip: A young sailor, Melson J. Bacos, 21, who has been fighting in the Iraq war pleaded guilty to watching two other Marines shoot a civilian in the head. He says he watched as the two marines kidnapped and shot an Iraqi civilian with at least 10 rounds of bullets. In this front page picture of the Marine as he walks into the courtroom, the sailor looks stern, stoic, and somewhat relieved. This war abuse case is similar to other young officers who have been guilty of listening to higher-ups when their moral conscience tell them not to. See the <a href="#">article in the New York Times</a>.

  title: Republicans are united against other Republicans

  tip: Republicans seem like a united party despite the fingerpointing at Republican, Dennis Hastert. Senator Dennis Hastert  has been blamed for not taking enough of a lead against the sexual wrongdoings to 16 year old pages by Rep. Tom Foley. Republican politicians are cancelling appearances with Se. Hastert in an effort to avoid being associated with weak leadership and moral incapacitance. By doing so, the Republicans seem united and strong. The Democrats seem like a silent group, basking in the negative attention that is not on them. Read from <a href="#">Talking Points Memo blog here</a>.
