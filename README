== OpenCongress Rails Project

-- Installing OpenCongress --

First of all, the OpenCongress project is a PostgreSQL only project.  Don't have delusions of using MySQL with it or you will be hurtin.  Since I personally had little experience with Postgres before this, I will include some tips for all you Mysql only guys and gals out there.

Here is what you have to do to get OpenCongress close to working on your personal machine :

  1. install postgresql

  2. install tsearch in contrib

  3. gem install ferret, bluecloth, simple-rss, postgres-pr

  4. copy config/database.sample to config/database.yml and edit it

  5. create the databases
	createdb opencongress_dev
	opencongress_dev < db/tsearch2.sql
  	createdb opencongress_test

  6. rake migrate

--

Next, you will have to get the data from govtrack and fill in your database with the parsed govtrack data

  mkdir /data/govtrack/109
  cd /data/govtrack/109
  rsync -az govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/109/bills .
  rsync -az govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/109/repstats .
  rsync -az govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/109/bills.index.xml .
  rsync -az govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/109/committeeschedule.xml .
  rsync -az govtrack.us::govtrackdata/us/109/rolls .

Now, you will have to actually parse the data

  ruby bin/govtrack_parse_people.rb
  ruby bin/govtrack_parse_bills.rb 
  ruby bin/govtrack_parse_committees.rb 
  ruby bin/govtrack_parse_committee_schedules.rb 
  ruby parse_individual_bills.rb 

--

Now, just run 'mongrel_rails start' and you should have something going on localhost:3000 - have fun!

Lastly, some Postgres tips:
  
  starting pg:  pg_ctl -D data -l logfile start
  accessing pg from the command line : psql opencongress_dev
